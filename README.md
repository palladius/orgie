# README

Orgie tries to re-implement my previous 'famous' work in PHP from http://www.goliardia.it/ in Ruby on Rails.
As the other (hostes by sourceforge), this is open source. Id like in the future to provde a 'gem' for a 'acts_like_tree' hierarchical relation

# What's this

* Rails '7'
* TODO(ricc): Nifty Generators if they still work

# UIssues

Doesnt seem to work on Mac w/ ARM  architecture. nokogiri is the usual.
wait with 2.7.5 it works!
